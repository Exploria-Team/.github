# Exploria

Exploria is a project designed to enhance travel experiences while promoting sustainable tourism in Indonesia. By leveraging advanced technologies like AI and machine learning, this system provides smart recommendations tailored to individual preferences, helping travelers explore Indonesia responsibly and meaningfully.

## Why Exploria?

Indonesia is striving to become one of the world’s top 10 global tourism destinations by 2045. This ambition is supported by remarkable growth in the tourism sector. According to the latest data from BPS-Statistics Indonesia, the country welcomed over 10 million foreign visitors by September 2024, a 20.28% increase from the same period in 2023. This steady rise reflects Indonesia's rich cultural and natural attractions, along with continuous improvements in tourism infrastructure.

In 2023 alone, Indonesia recorded 14.5 million international arrivals, up from 10.4 million in 2022. Tourism contributed significantly to the national economy, accounting for 5.5% of GDP. However, such rapid growth presents challenges, particularly in ensuring that development does not compromise the environment or cultural heritage. The increasing popularity of destinations demands solutions that balance economic gains with sustainability and preservation.

Exploria is our answer to this challenge. By promoting eco-friendly, culturally respectful tourism, it aligns with Indonesia's vision for responsible and sustainable travel, ensuring future generations can enjoy the country's natural and cultural wonders.

## Our Goals

Exploria is designed to:
- Provide personalized travel recommendations to match individual preferences.
- Promote sustainable tourism practices to protect Indonesia's environment and cultural assets.
- Encourage responsible travel choices that create meaningful experiences for visitors while preserving the country’s unique heritage.
